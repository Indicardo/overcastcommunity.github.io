Hey everyone! We've been toying with the idea of opening up community made map submissions for a few months now, and after some recent support was added to PGM, we've happy to announce that it's finally happening!

The submission window is going to be open indefinitely. This post will go through the submission process and answer some obvious questions, be sure to read everything! 

## The submission process

Submissions will be done [here](https://github.com/OvercastCommunity/CommunityMaps/issues/new/choose). To submit your map, select the Map Submission template, and fill in the correct information. If you're looking for any more help, feel free to refer to this example map submission found [here](https://github.com/OvercastCommunity/CommunityMaps/issues/1).

A Map Developer will respond to your map submission issue and give feedback, be open to altering some map details if necessary. They'll go though your XML and point out any issues as well. If the map is accepted, it'll be added to the server for testing. We'll try and run some sort of community map testing event every week or so. If more changes are needed before putting the map up on the public rotation, feedback will be posted on the same issue you originally opened.

Know that by submitting a map to the community [repository](https://github.com/OvercastCommunity/CommunityMaps), you are also agreeing to put your map under the same license as the repository itself (CC BY-SA). For more information about licensing you can read [here](https://github.com/OvercastCommunity/CommunityMaps/blob/master/README.md).

## What are we looking for?

We're excited to see what you can create, getting some new maps for our map pools would be awesome! If you made a map for another server, or even if you still have a map kicking around from a map submission you never got around to on OCN, feel free to submit it, we'll accept those as well.

As for what sort of map you can submit, go wild. We're trying to make sure we don't set too many limitations, however we figure it's worth mentioning that a map catered to fit in one of our more commonly active map pools has a higher chance of being played, if accepted. (list map pools here, idk what they are)

## FAQ

### I don't know XML, what do I do?

If you need help with your XML you can read through the documentation over at [pgm.dev](https://pgm.dev) or ask for help in #maps in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/occ).

### Can my submission get closed for inactivity?

Yes, if you get a response on your submission make sure to respond to it before 7 days has passed. Any submission with a reply from a map dev which is inactive for 7 days will be closed. Do not re-open closed issues!

### I have an update for a map I made that was accepted, how do I submit it?

Create another map submission issue with the download for the new updated map, and explain what's been changed in the issue.
